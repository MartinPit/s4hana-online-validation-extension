# Creating Your Own Validation

## Prerequisites
Online Validation (OVS) is an ABAP-based service available for SAP S/4 HANA systems. You will need to implement the SAP Notes with the Online Validation or upgrade to a corresponding Support package level. The list of all available corrections is attached to the SAP Note [3085468](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3085468).

## Preparation
Learn about how to implement and activate a new validation in your system. 
Make sure you read through all the sections before start coding so you can reuse the [example class](../src/zcl_ovs_example.clas.abap) from this repository and the existing code in your system.
